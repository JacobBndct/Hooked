# Hooked - CSCI 4168 Project
###### By Jacob Benedict, Tristan Duke, Akil Fernando, & Mars Semenova

A meta fishing simulator game with gacha mechanics that communicates a background narrative about the consequences of gambling. 

Hooked implements a simple, fun, and addictive gameplay loop which involves resource management and unlocking new upgrades, items, and locations by catching and selling fish.

There is also a gacha system to customize a pet fish. To accompany this, there is a subtle story as the player progresses about the dangers of gambling.
